# Armor
A text-based adventure game.

**This game is work-in-progress! Future plans include its compilation to native code.**

## Controls
As a text-based game, Armor runs in command-line interface. Thus you navigate by pressing keys on your keyboard. Available keys are shown after any other information on current page in brackets along with information about what they do.

### Combat
**This part is a *proposal* - any features listed here are not implemented yet!**
Combat in Armor is turn-based. You and your enemy have a limited number of actions you can perform (like casting spells, attacking with friendly character or healing) and each of them has a unique key you can press to perform it.
